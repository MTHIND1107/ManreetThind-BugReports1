**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I'm always frustrated when I cannot easily switch between different accounts within the mobile app. It's cumbersome to log out and log back in each time I need to access a different account.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like to have a built-in feature that allows seamless switching between multiple accounts within the app. This feature should enable users to switch accounts with just a few taps, without the need to log out and log back in repeatedly.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
1. Manual Logout/Login: While the current method of logging out and logging back in technically allows switching between accounts, it's time-consuming and interrupts the user experience.
2. Separate Instances: Some users might resort to installing multiple instances of the app to manage different accounts, but this approach clutters the device and lacks integration between accounts.

**Additional context**
This feature would greatly enhance user convenience, especially for individuals who manage multiple accounts, such as social media influencers, business owners, or users with personal and work-related accounts.
