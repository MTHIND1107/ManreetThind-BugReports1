**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I'm always frustrated when I can't save my progress in the app, especially when I'm in the middle of a task or activity. It's inconvenient to lose my work or progress due to unexpected interruptions or app crashes.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like to see an automatic progress-saving feature implemented in the app. This feature should periodically save users' progress across various tasks or activities, ensuring that their work is preserved even if the app is closed or crashes unexpectedly.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
1. Manual Save Option: While users can manually save their progress in some apps, relying solely on manual saves requires users to remember to save frequently, which can be cumbersome and prone to human error.
2. Autosave on Exit: Some apps automatically save progress when the user exits the app, but this approach may not account for unexpected interruptions or app crashes during usage.

**Additional context**
The implementation of an automatic progress-saving feature would significantly improve the user experience by reducing the risk of data loss and enhancing user confidence in the app's reliability. This feature would be particularly beneficial for productivity apps, note-taking apps, and any application involving complex tasks or workflows. It would ensure that users can pick up right where they left off without any hassle.
